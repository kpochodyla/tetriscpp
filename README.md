# tetriscpp
Implementation of tetris game in C++ with SDL library 
All scoring and level progression is based on information avaible at tetris.wiki
To play you need to use arrows keys:
  - up: rotate the piece
  - left/right: move the piece to the left/right
  - down: speed up the drop

and the space for insta drop (place of the drop is indicated by the ghost block).
To exit the game you can press the ESC button.
When in the starting menu you can press up and down arrows to change the starting level.
When in the GAME OVER menu pressing the space button will restart the game by launching the starting menu again.

I consider this project as finished, thats why there will be no more updates to the code.
